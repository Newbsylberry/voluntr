    will compete to record the most hours at local nonprofits. Volu, a volunteer management software company based in
    Syracuse, will be providing the technology required to execute the VOLUnteer Drive and offering up to $5,000
    in micro-grants to local nonprofit organizations to host volunteer events.  Additional information can be found

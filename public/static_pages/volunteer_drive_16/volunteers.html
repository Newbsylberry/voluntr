  <h2>Volunteers</h2>
  <p>
    The VOLUnteer Drive is a great way for any team, group, or institution to give back to the
    community. We welcome volunteer organizations and groups to join the volunteer drive. We
    are already working with organizations like Believe in Syracuse, 40 Below, Young Leaders
    United, and Syracuse University, to name a few. We still have room for more!
    We are actively looking for schools (middle schools, high schools, colleges) and nonprofit
    affiliated councils to join our cause. Please notify AJ Richichi immediate at aj@voluapp.com if
    youâ€™re interested in getting involved.

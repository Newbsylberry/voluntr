  <li>    Term and Termination.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Term.  These Terms shall remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with this Section 6.</li>
    <li>Right to Terminate. We may, at any time, without notice to you, terminate your access to the Service, and your Account, or block your access to the Service, for any reason, including if we believe in our sole discretion that you may have violated these Terms or have otherwise engaged in any activities that may harm or damage the reputation, rights, person, or property of Volu, our users, or any other person; or requested by law enforcement or other government agencies.</li>
    <li>Notice of Termination. If applicable law requires us to provide notice of termination or cancellation, we may give prior or subsequent notice by posting it on the Site or by sending a communication to any address (email or otherwise) that we have for you in our records.</li>
    <li>Effect of Termination. Upon termination of your Account or the Service, your agreement with Volu pursuant to these Terms will also terminate, except that the following provisions survive the termination: Section 2 “Posting Content on the Site,” Section 3 “Ownership of Content; License,” Section 5 “Monitoring and Protection of Content,” Section 6 “Term and Termination,” Section 8 “Warranty and Indemnification,” and Section 11 “Miscellaneous” and the Privacy Policy.

  </ol>
  <li>Links to Third Party Sites.</li>
  <p>Our Site may contain links to third party web sites. The linked sites are not part of the Site and are not under our control. Consequently, we are not responsible for the accuracy, legality, decency, availability or content of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to such sites. We provide the links to you only as a convenience, and we do not endorse the linked site or its use or contents.  You use the links at your own risk.  You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.</p>
  <li>      Warranty and Indemnification.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Warranty Disclaimer.  Volu provides the Service “as is” and “as available” to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Volu makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Service or the Content included in the Service. Volu makes no representations or warranties that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, virus-free, secure, or timely. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Volu expressly disclaims all representations, warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including the implied representations, warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement and those arising from a course of dealing, trade, usage or performance. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, and therefore some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</li>
    <li>Indemnification.  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Volu, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates (“Indemnified Persons”), from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), made against Volu by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.</li>
    <li>Limitation of Liability.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, none of the indemnified persons are liable to you or any other person for indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, special, statutory, or consequential damages, lost profits, lost revenue, loss of data, loss of privacy, loss of goodwill or any other losses, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and even in the event of fault, tort (including negligence) or strict or product liability.  You assume total responsibility for your use of the Service.  Your only remedy against Volu for dissatisfaction with the Service or any Content posted on the Site is to stop using the Service.  If, notwithstanding these Terms, Volu is found liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Service or any Content posted on the Site, Volu’s liability shall in no event exceed $1.00.  Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitations may not apply to you.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>     Notices and Contact Information.</li>
  <p>Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, Volu will give you any notices, and you hereby authorize Volu to send notices (including notice of subpoenas or other legal process, if any), via electronic mail to the email address that we have on record for you. You will be considered to have received a notice when sent by Volu via electronic mail, whether or not received by you. Volu may provide notice to any email or other address that you provide to us. You must keep your address current and any notice sent by Volu to the address that you have most recently provided is effective notice. Any notice you provide to us must be sent by mail to Volu, Inc.,  chris@Volu.com.</p>
  <li>    Amendments.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Changes to Terms. At any time and for any reason, Volu may change or update these Terms, which includes the Privacy Policy and any other agreement that is incorporated by reference into these Terms, without notice to you.  Any change or update made by us will be prospective only.  You can always find the most recent version of the Terms here, and you are responsible for checking here periodically so that you understand our current terms and policies.  By using the Service after any such change, you agree to comply with and be bound by the Terms as changed.</li>
    <li>Your Obligation to Stay Current. It is critical that you keep your email contact information correct and updated with Volu at all times. In addition, we encourage you to check back regularly to review these Terms.</li>
    <li>Changes to Service.  We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, and restrict or block access to, the Service without notice to you. We may modify or remove any Content from the Service at any time without notice to you, including removal of Content that we believe to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable. We are not liable for any such modification, suspension, discontinuance or removal, and any such action by us will not affect Volu’s license to your Content as stated in Section 3 above.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Miscellaneous.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Agreement to Conduct Transactions Electronically. All of your transactions with or through the Service may, at our option, be conducted electronically from start to finish. If the law allows you to withdraw this consent or if we are ever required to deal with you non-electronically, we reserve the right to charge or increase fees and you agree to print or make an electronic copy of the Terms and any other contract or disclosure that we are required to provide to you.</li>
    <li>Interpretation. The paragraph headings in these Terms are included to help make these Terms easier to read and have no binding effect. As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including” are meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive.</li>
    <li>No Agency; No Third Party Beneficiary. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship. Except for the Indemnified Persons, there are no third party beneficiaries of these Terms.</li>
    <li>Severance. If any part of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remainder will remain in full effect, provided that the allocation of risks described in these Terms is given effect to the fullest extent possible.</li>
    <li>Assignment. These Terms are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or delegate them to anyone without the express written permission of Volu. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer or delegate these Terms without the express written permission of Volu will be null and void. Volu has the right to transfer, assign and delegate these Terms to one or more third parties without your permission.</li>
    <li>Jurisdiction; Choice of Law; Export Limitations. This Service is controlled by us from our offices in the United States of America and is directed to U.S. users. If you access the Service from locations outside the U.S., you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export anything from the Service in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations or the Terms. These Terms and all performances and claims of every nature between us are governed by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. You and Volu submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located within Onondaga County, New York.</li>
    <li>Limitations on Actions. Any action concerning any dispute with respect to the Service must be commenced within one year after the cause of the dispute arises, or the cause of action is barred.</li>
    <li>Entire Agreement. These Terms comprise the entire agreement between you and Volu with respect to the use of the Service and supersede all contemporaneous and prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein.</li>
    <li>No Waiver. The failure of any party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms, including any failure to act with respect to a breach, will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or that party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We suggest that you print out a copy of these Terms for your records.</li>
    <li>Specific Performance.  You agree that any breach or violation by you of any of these Terms will cause Volu irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Volu obtaining injunctive or equitable relief, without being required to post a bond, if Volu seeks such relief under the circumstances.  Such injunctive or equitable relief would be in addition to any other remedies that Volu might have at law.</li>
